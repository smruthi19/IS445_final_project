IS445 - Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class
My biggest takeaway from this class is the various data visualizations that are available to represent data in different ways. Through learning and working with libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, etc. I have learned about the different types of charts that can be used to represent data. I also learned about how to represent data based on the audience and how to emphasize certain aspects of the data through applying certain visualization techniques. Through analyzing data visualizations for the weekly visualization reports, I was able to understand different aspects of data visualization like interactivity, appeal, quantitative vs. qualitative, etc. I hope to continue to build data visualizations and continue to explore this area.

Further improvements
Overall, I was very happy with the structure and assignments in this class. I was able to explore the topics through the assignment and found the videos and links very helpful. One suggestion that I have for improving the class would be having a document with the different types of visualizations that we have discussed and what type of data representation each one is best for since I tended to search up documentation for the different visualizations often. Another suggestion that I have for improving the class would be integrating machine learning with data visualizations in one of the units. Overall, I enjoyed the class and learning about data visualization.
